            <p class="mb-4"><strong>Daily Play Limit:</strong> PlayStella is designed as a daily game. You may play once per day, as determined by your device's local date/time. This limitation is a core feature of the game design.</p>
            <p class="mb-4"><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Game progress (scores, streaks, play dates, and action history) is stored locally on your device using browser storage. Action history includes records of your gameplay actions and their outcomes (e.g., "good," "bad," "neutral") which are used to generate the visual grid when sharing results. We are not responsible for data loss due to:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
              <li>Browser cache clearing</li>
              <li>Device changes or resets</li>
              <li>Browser updates or compatibility issues</li>
              <li>Any other technical issues beyond our control</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-4"><strong>Share Feature:</strong> The game includes a share feature that generates a text summary of your gameplay, including time, actions, streak, and a visual grid representing action outcomes. When you use the share feature, you choose to share this information via your device's native sharing capabilities or clipboard. We do not transmit or store this shared information on our servers.</p>

              <p class="text-sm">You agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of PlayStella shall be settled by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except as otherwise provided below.</p>

            <p class="mb-4"><strong>Arbitration Agreement:</strong></p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
              <li><strong>Binding Nature:</strong> You and PlayStella agree to resolve disputes through final and binding arbitration instead of through court litigation (except as provided in the Exceptions section below).</li>
              <li><strong>Arbitration Rules:</strong> The arbitration shall be conducted under the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) or JAMS, at your choice.</li>
              <li><strong>Location:</strong> Any arbitration hearings will take place in King County, Washington, or may be conducted remotely via video conference at the arbitrator's discretion.</li>
              <li><strong>Costs:</strong> Each party shall bear their own legal fees and costs. The arbitrator's fees shall be split equally between the parties, unless the arbitrator determines otherwise.</li>
              <li><strong>Single Arbitrator:</strong> The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator.</li>
              <li><strong>Arbitrator's Authority:</strong> The arbitrator may award any relief that a court could award, including attorneys' fees when authorized by law. The arbitrator's decision is final and binding, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="mb-4"><strong>Class Action Waiver:</strong></p>
            <p class="mb-4">You agree that any arbitration or proceeding shall be limited to the dispute between you and PlayStella individually. To the full extent permitted by law:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
              <li>No arbitration or proceeding shall be joined with any other</li>
              <li>There is no right or authority for any dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures</li>
              <li>There is no right or authority for any dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons</li>

            <p class="mb-4">Either party may seek relief in small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction. Additionally, disputes concerning intellectual property rights (such as trademark or copyright infringement) may be brought in court rather than arbitration.</p>
            
            <p class="mb-4"><strong>30-Day Opt-Out Right:</strong></p>
            <p class="mb-4">You have the right to opt out of this arbitration agreement. To opt out, you must send written notice to legal@playstella.com within 30 days of first accepting these Terms. Your notice must include your name and a clear statement that you wish to opt out of the arbitration agreement. If you opt out, all other terms of these Terms will continue to apply, but disputes will be resolved in court rather than arbitration.</p>
            
            <p class="mb-4"><strong>Severability of Arbitration Clause:</strong></p>
            <p>If any portion of this arbitration agreement is found to be unenforceable, the remainder shall continue in full force and effect. If the class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, the entire arbitration agreement (but not the remainder of these Terms) shall be null and void.</p>
