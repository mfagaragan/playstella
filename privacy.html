          <section>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-light text-gray-900 mb-4">Information We Collect</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">PlayStella collects minimal information to provide you with the best gaming experience:</p>
            
            <h3 class="text-xl font-light text-gray-900 mb-3 mt-6">1. Automatically Collected Information</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
              <li><strong>IP Address:</strong> When you visit our site, your IP address is automatically logged by our hosting provider (Netlify) for security, performance, and anonymous analytics purposes. We do not directly access, store, or use your IP address to identify you personally.</li>
              <li><strong>Anonymous Analytics Data:</strong> Our hosting provider collects server-side analytics including pageviews, unique visitors (counted by IP address), geographic location (country/region level), pages visited, and bandwidth usage. This data is anonymized and aggregated — no individual user tracking occurs.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-light text-gray-900 mb-3 mt-6">2. Browser Storage (Local Storage)</h3>
            <p class="mb-3">We use browser local storage (similar to cookies) to save your game progress locally on your device. This data never leaves your device and includes:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Last Play Date:</strong> To enforce the once-per-day play limit (stored as date string, e.g., "Fri Oct 22 2025")</li>
              <li><strong>Best Time:</strong> Your personal best score (stored as numeric value, e.g., "15.7")</li>
              <li><strong>Streak Count:</strong> Number of consecutive days played (stored as numeric value)</li>
              <li><strong>Last Game Stats:</strong> Your most recent game time and action count for sharing purposes</li>
              <li><strong>Last Game History:</strong> A record of your last game's action outcomes (e.g., whether actions were "good," "bad," or "neutral") used to generate the visual grid when sharing results. This is stored as an anonymous array with no personal identifiers.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mt-3 text-sm text-gray-600"><strong>Important:</strong> This information is stored only on your device and is never transmitted to our servers or any third parties. The action history contains no personal information—only generic game outcomes like "pet: good" or "treat: bad" that are used to create the colorful share grid.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-light text-gray-900 mb-3 mt-6">3. Information We Do NOT Collect</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li>Names, email addresses, or contact information</li>
              <li>Payment or financial information</li>
              <li>Social media profiles or account credentials</li>
              <li>Precise geolocation data</li>
              <li>Personal identifiers or tracking cookies</li>
              <li>Behavioral tracking or analytics data</li>

            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
              <li><strong>Game Functionality:</strong> Local storage data enables core game features like daily play limits, score tracking, streak counters, and the visual share feature</li>
              <li><strong>Share Feature:</strong> Action history is used solely to generate the colorful grid display when you share your results. This data remains on your device and is only included in share text if you choose to share.</li>
              <li><strong>Site Security:</strong> IP addresses logged by our hosting provider help prevent abuse and ensure site security</li>
              <li><strong>Anonymous Analytics:</strong> Server-side analytics help us understand site traffic patterns, popular pages, and overall usage trends to improve the game experience. All analytics are anonymous and aggregated — we cannot and do not track individual users.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mt-4"><strong>We do not:</strong></p>
